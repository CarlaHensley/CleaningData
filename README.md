# CleaningData
On this file, I have perfomed binding and mergin of two files: "test" and "train".
First I read the files into R and downloaded them properly. Then I checked the names and dimension of the files in order
to get a better picture of what the data looked like.

Then I have bound the train data (x and y parts) together and I performed the same operation for the test data.

Finally, I merged the two files to create one file with one merged data frame
